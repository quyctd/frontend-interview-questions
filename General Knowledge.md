### Compare GraphQL vs Rest API
A REST API is an architectural concept for network-based software. GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language, a specification, and a set of tools that operates over a single endpoint using HTTP. In addition, over the last few years, REST has been used to make new APIs, while the focus of GraphQL has been to optimize for performance and flexibility.

With REST, you have to make three requests to different endpoints to fetch the required data. You’re also overfetching since the endpoints return additional information that’s not needed.

Using GraphQL, the client can specify exactly the data it needs in a query. Notice that the structure of the server’s response follows precisely the nested structure defined in the query.

=> No more Over- and Underfetching
